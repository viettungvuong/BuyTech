# BuyTech

Basically, this is an app just like Chợ Tốt or Facebook Marketplace, in which you can find and buy used technological devices. However, I'm building this app to make it more customer-oriented with features (idk whether they are neccessary!?) like price overview, tag overview. 

This app implements a NoSQL solution from Google, Firestore Firebase as a storage means. 




## What I've used so far

**Client:** Kotlin

**Server:** Firestore Firebase
